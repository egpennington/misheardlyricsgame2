            Oh, but they're wild and they're playful
            Oh, Honey, it's really neat

            They've got candy shoes, a chocolate suit
            You know I read it in a candy wrapper, oh

            Unsealed on a porch a letter sat
            Then you said I wanna leave it again
            Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
            And on the sand I wanna leave it again, yeah

            On a weekend wanna wish it all away
            And they called and I said that I want what I said
            And then I call out again
            And the reason oughtta leave her calm, I know
            I said I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag

            Oh yeah, can you see them
            Out on the porch
            Yeah but they don't wave
            I see them

            Come on, Eileen
            Come on, Eileen
            Poor old Johnnie Ray
            Sounded sad upon the radio
            Moved a million hearts in mono
            Our mothers cried
            Sang along, who'd blame them?
            You've grown (you're grown up)
            So grown (so grown up)
            Now I must say more than ever
            (Come on, Eileen)
            Too-ra-loo-ra
            Too-ra-loo-rye-ay
            And we can sing just like our fathers

            Come on, Eileen
            These people 'round here
            Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
            They're so resigned to what their fate is
            But not us (no never)
            But not us (not ever)
            We are far too young and clever
            (Remember)
            Too-ra-loo-ra
            Too-ra-loo-rye-ay
            And you'll hum this tune forever
            Come on, Eileen
            Oh, I swear (what he means)
            Ah, come on, let's
            Take off everything
            That pretty red dress

            Now I must say more than ever (too-ra, ta-loo-ra)
            Things 'round here have changed

            Anytime I need to see your face, I just close my eyes
            And I am taken to a place where your crystal mind
            And magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine
            Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola
            I don't need to try to explain; I just hold on tight
            And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
            To the arms and the lips and the face of the human cannonball
            That I need to, I want to
            
            Come stand a little bit closer
            Breathe in and get a bit higher
            You'll never know what hit you
            When I get to you
            
            Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
            Ooh, I'd die to find out
            Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
            Ooh, I'd die to find out
            
            I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
            Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for
            But a look, then a smell of perfume
            It's like I'm down on the floor and I don't know what I'm in for
            Conversation has a time and place
            In the interaction of a lover and a mate
            But the time of talking, using symbols, using words
            Can be likened to a deep sea diver
            Who is swimming with a raincoat
            
            Come stand a little bit closer
            Breathe in and get a bit higher
            You'll never know what hit you
            When I get to you
            
            Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
            Ooh, I'd die to find out
            Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
            Ooh, I'd die to find out
            
            Yeah yeah
            Yeah yeah
            
            Anytime I need to see your face, I just close my eyes
